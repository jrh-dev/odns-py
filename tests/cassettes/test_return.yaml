        Surveillance Web Tool that allows data collectors in NHS boards to validate
        ECOSS records as well as add additional cases that may not be included in
        the ECOSS system. This therefore means that completeness is near to 100%.
        Only cases reviewed in the enhanced surveillance are included in the ''analysis''
        in the commentary publication.  CDI: Diagnosis of CDI is confirmed in a patient
        who is both symptomatic with diarrhoea and whose stool has tested positive
        for toxin using a two-step diagnostic algorithm. Laboratory reports of positive
        samples are then sent to ECOSS for data extraction. In the community, patients
        with CDI may have a mild illness that does not require a GP visit, or the
        symptoms may not be recognised by a GP for a C. difficile test request. In
        hospitals, the chance of a diarrhoea sample not being tested for C. difficile
        is much lower, and patients who have ileus (i.e., CDI but with no diarrhoea)
        might be missed, however as a result of HPS published guidance on managing
        CDI patients, this is not likely. HPS carries out validation with the NHS
        boards to check that no CDI cases have been missed from ECOSS each quarter.
        As with most surveillance programmes, completeness will not be 100% but mandatory
        surveillance, supported by HPS through issued guidance on diagnosis of CDI
        and validation of cases, ensures this is as near to 100% as practically possible.
        When categorising by healthcare or community, not all cases may be successfully
        data linked in any one quarter therefore could be subject to revision once
        further information becomes available.  SSI: Surveillance coordinators are
        responsible for completeness and accuracy of data. At hospital level, processes
        are in placed to ensure all patients included in the standard surveillance
        have had forms completed (e.g. cross checking with admission or theatre list).
        HPS also compare SSIRS data with data from ISD to a make sure all procedures
        under surveillance have been included; however, this comparison is only done
        annually.", "nhs_accuracy": "CDI, ECB and SAB data are the product of the
        Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS). Participating
        laboratories routinely report all identifications of organisms, infection
        or microbiological intoxication, unless they are known to be of no clinical
        or public health importance. The collected data is used for; the identification
        of single cases of severe disease, outbreaks, and longer term trends in the
        incidence of laboratory reported infections enhanced surveillance, health
        protection, analytical and statistical use. Delays in SMR01 data availability
        at the time of report production means that some CDI cases may be reassigned
        at a later date. Therefore, healthcare-associated and community-associated
        CDI cases in this report are provisional and may change. The enhanced ECB
        and SAB ECOSS web tool has built-in validation rules that have to be met before
        the data is submitted. Further checks of the data are made by HPS before the
        data are analysed. CDI validation of collected data entails sending a list
        of CDI cases extracted from ECOSS and asking for confirmation that the cases
        represent true CDI cases, i.e., meet the case definition which is defined
        in the surveillance protocol sent to all the NHS boards and available on the
        HPS website. The final list of CDI cases is then agreed before publishing.
        SSI data comes from the Surgical Site Infection Reporting System (SSIRS).
        Complying with a national minimum dataset and definitions for Surgical Site
        Infections, enables the data submitted to Health Protection Scotland to be
        mapped into the national dataset following a rigorous quality assurance process.
        SSIRS has built-in validation rules and data cannot be submitted until rules
        are met. SSIRS primary validation checks for incomplete or ambiguous core
        data fields, for example, if presentation to the surgery is \u2019emergency\u2019
        the OPCS code should correspond. Secondary validation includes data checks
        that can be accepted without completion and/or values that are outside the
        stated requirements.", "nhs_relevance": "This data is used to produce the

        to develop and deliver services for those children and young people (and their
        parents/carers) who are experiencing the most serious mental health problems.
        They also have an important role in supporting the mental health capability
        of the wider network of children''s services. CAMHS are usually delivered
        by multidisciplinary teams including nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists,
        social workers, and others.\r\n\r\nDelivery of good quality CAMHS depends
        on adequate numbers of well trained staff being recruited and retained across
        NHSScotland. Practitioners who contribute to CAMHS include: psychiatric nurses,
        child and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers,
        psychotherapists (including child/analytical, systemic/family, cognitive behavioural),
        creative therapists (including art, music and drama), play therapists, liaison
        teachers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and dieticians.\r\n\r\nTimely
        access to healthcare is a key measure of quality and that applies equally
        in respect of access to mental health services. Early action is more likely
        to result in full recovery and, in the case of children and young people,
        will also minimise the impact on other aspects of their development such as
        their education, so improving their wider social development outcomes.\r\n\r\nCAMHS
        are subject to deliver an 18 week wait from referral to treatment for specialist
        services this has been the standard since December 2014. This supersedes the
        previous target of 26 weeks. The data shows the performances of the board
        in relation to this standard.", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence
