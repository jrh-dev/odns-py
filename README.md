# odns - access Open Data from NHS Scotland

**Work in progress** - port of the R package `odns` which provides a base for exploring and obtaining data available through the [Scottish Health and Social Care Open Data platform](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/). The package provides a wrapper for the underlying [CKAN](https://ckan.org) API and simplifies the process of accessing the available data with R, allowing users to quickly explore the available data and start using it without having to write complex queries.
